# Technical Notes

## CCLAW_HOME Environment Variable

The runtime data path defaults to `~/.cclaw/` and can be changed via the `CCLAW_HOME` environment variable.
In tests, isolation is achieved via `monkeypatch.setenv("CCLAW_HOME", str(tmp_path))`.

## Path Management Principles

All paths use absolute paths. The `bot_directory(name)` function in `config.py` returns the absolute path `cclaw_home() / "bots" / name`, and other modules access bot directories through this function. Absolute paths are also stored in bot entries in `config.yaml`. Avoid relative paths and use `pathlib.Path` for path composition.

## Telegram Message Limit

Telegram messages have a maximum of 4096 characters. `utils.split_message()` splits long responses for delivery.
It attempts to split at line break boundaries, and truncates at the limit when no suitable line break is found.

## Claude Code Execution

Two execution modes are supported:

- **Batch mode**: `claude -p "<message>" --output-format text` (cron, heartbeat, etc.)
- **Streaming mode**: `claude -p "<message>" --output-format stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages` (Telegram conversations)

The working directory is set to the session directory via the subprocess `cwd` parameter.

- `shutil.which("claude")` resolves the full path to the Claude CLI. Works regardless of installation method (`uv run`, `pip install`, `pipx install`, etc.) by searching PATH. Raises `RuntimeError` with installation guidance if not found.
- `--output-format text`: Text output (not JSON)
- `--model <model>`: Model selection (sonnet/opus/haiku). Flag is omitted when `model` parameter is None.
- Additional arguments can be passed via the `claude_args` field in `bot.yaml`
- Default timeout: 300 seconds (`command_timeout` in `config.yaml`)

## Model Selection

- Valid models: `VALID_MODELS = ["sonnet", "opus", "haiku"]`, default: `DEFAULT_MODEL = "sonnet"`
- Model version mapping: `MODEL_VERSIONS = {"sonnet": "4.5", "opus": "4.6", "haiku": "3.5"}`
- `model_display_name()`: Appends version to model name (e.g., `opus 4.6`)
- `/model` command displays current model and list with version info
- Stored in `bot.yaml`'s `model` field. Runtime changeable via Telegram `/model` command.
- Runtime changes reflected via `nonlocal current_model` in handler closure.
- Model changes are immediately saved to bot.yaml via `save_bot_config()`.
- Also changeable via CLI `cclaw bot model <name> [model]`.

## Process Tracking (/cancel)

- Module-level `_running_processes` dictionary maps `{bot_name}:{chat_id}` to subprocess
- When `session_key` is passed to `run_claude()`, the process is automatically registered/deregistered
- `/cancel` command calls `cancel_process()` which invokes `process.kill()` (SIGKILL)
- When process is killed: `returncode == -9` -> raises `asyncio.CancelledError`
- Handler catches `CancelledError` and sends "Execution was cancelled" message

## Graceful Shutdown (cancel_all_processes)

`cancel_all_processes()` iterates `_running_processes` and kills all running subprocesses (`returncode is None`), then clears the registry.

Called first in `bot_manager.py`'s shutdown sequence (before `application.stop()`). Without this, `application.stop()` waits for running handler coroutines to complete, which blocks until the Claude subprocess finishes (up to `command_timeout`, default 300 seconds). By killing subprocesses first, the handlers complete immediately and shutdown proceeds without delay.

## Session Lock and Message Queuing

Concurrent requests from the same chat are processed sequentially via `asyncio.Lock`.
When the lock is held, a "Message queued. Processing previous request..." notification is sent before waiting.
Lock key format: `{bot_name}:{chat_id}`.

## /send Command

Command to send workspace files via Telegram.
- `/send` (no args): Shows list of available files
- `/send <filename>`: Sends the file via `reply_document()`
- Returns "File not found" message if file doesn't exist

## launchd Daemon

`cclaw start --daemon` creates `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.cclaw.daemon.plist` and runs `launchctl load`.
`KeepAlive` is enabled so the process auto-restarts on termination.
`cclaw stop` runs `launchctl unload` then deletes the plist.

## Bot Error Isolation

In `bot_manager.py`, individual bot configuration errors or startup failures don't affect other bots.
- Config load/token errors: Skips the bot and proceeds to the next
- Polling start failure: Only that bot is skipped, others run normally
- `started_applications` list tracks actually started bots for cleanup on shutdown

## Telegram API Mocking in Tests

`telegram.Bot` is imported inside functions, so it's mocked via `patch("telegram.Bot")`.
`AsyncMock` is used to mock async methods like `get_me()`.

## allowed_users

When `allowed_users` in `bot.yaml` is an empty list, all users are allowed for incoming messages.
To restrict access, add Telegram user IDs (integers) to the list.

For proactive messages (cron results, heartbeat notifications), `allowed_users` is needed as the target. When empty, `collect_session_chat_ids()` in `session.py` scans `sessions/chat_<id>/` directories as a fallback — sending results to users who have previously chatted with the bot.

## Daemon Auto-Restart on Bot Creation

When a new bot is created via `cclaw init` or `cclaw bot add` while the daemon is already running, the daemon is automatically restarted to pick up the new bot. This ensures the new bot's Telegram polling and command menu are registered immediately.

- `_is_daemon_running()` in `onboarding.py` checks if the launchd plist file exists
- `_restart_daemon()` calls `stop_bots()` then `start_bots(daemon=True)`
- If the daemon is not running, a message is shown: "Start the bot: cclaw start"
- If restart fails, a manual restart command is displayed as fallback

## Telegram Command Menu

The `BOT_COMMANDS` list is registered with Telegram via the `set_my_commands()` API.
Called after `start_polling()` completes on bot start (`bot_manager.py`). Command registration failure is caught and logged as a warning — it does not prevent the bot from running.
After registration, typing `/` displays the command autocomplete menu.
Adding/changing commands only requires a bot restart.

## Telegram Formatting Rules

The Rules section in `compose_claude_md()` includes a "No Markdown tables" rule.
Telegram doesn't render Markdown tables, so `| Header | Content |` format appears as raw text.
Instead, an "emoji + text list" format is enforced (e.g., `🌡 Low -2°C / High 7°C`).

## Markdown to Telegram HTML Conversion

Claude's Markdown responses are converted to Telegram HTML before sending (`utils.markdown_to_telegram_html()`).

- `[text](url)` -> `<a href="url">text</a>` (links extracted before HTML escaping to preserve URLs)
- `**bold**` -> `<b>bold</b>`
- `*italic*` -> `<i>italic</i>`
- `` `code` `` -> `<code>code</code>`
- ` ```code blocks``` ` -> `<pre>code blocks</pre>`
- `## heading` -> `<b>heading</b>` (Telegram has no heading support, so bold is used)
- Falls back to plain text if HTML send fails

## Streaming On/Off Toggle

- `bot.yaml`'s `streaming` field: `false` (default) or `true`
- Default constant: `DEFAULT_STREAMING = False` in `config.py`
- Runtime changes reflected via `nonlocal streaming_enabled` in handler closure.
- Runtime toggle via Telegram `/streaming on|off`, immediately saved via `save_bot_config()`.
- Also changeable via CLI `cclaw bot streaming <name> [on|off]`.
- `message_handler` and `file_handler` call `_send_streaming_response()` or `_send_non_streaming_response()` based on `streaming_enabled`.
- Non-streaming mode: typing action every 4 seconds + `run_claude()` + Markdown->HTML conversion + split send (restored Phase 3 pattern).

## Streaming Response

### Execution Mode

`run_claude_streaming()` runs Claude Code with `--output-format stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages` flags.
Reads stdout line by line and parses JSON events.

### stream-json Event Parsing

Three event types are processed:

- `stream_event` + `content_block_delta` + `text_delta`: Per-token text (--verbose mode)
- `assistant` message `content` blocks: Turn-level text (fallback)
- `result`: Final complete text

The `result` event text is used first; if absent, accumulated streaming text is used.

### Telegram Message Editing Strategy

- First `reply_text()` sent after at least 10 characters (`STREAM_MIN_CHARS_BEFORE_SEND`) accumulated
- Subsequent `edit_message_text()` calls at 0.5 second (`STREAM_THROTTLE_SECONDS`) intervals
- Cursor marker `▌` (`STREAMING_CURSOR`) appended to text end to show progress
- Streaming preview stops when exceeding 4096 characters (`stream_stopped = True`)
- On completion: single chunk gets HTML-formatted message edit, multiple chunks get preview deletion + split send

### Typing Action

For non-streaming paths (cron, heartbeat) and streaming-off conversation messages, the typing action approach is used.
`send_action("typing")` sent every 4 seconds via `asyncio.create_task` for background execution.

## File Receiving

When photos/documents are received, they're downloaded to workspace then passed to Claude with the file path.
Photos use the largest size (`photo[-1]`).

## Skill System

### Skill Types

- **Markdown-only** (no `skill.yaml`): Just `SKILL.md` makes it always active. No separate configuration needed.
- **Tool-based** (`skill.yaml` present): `type` is cli/mcp/browser. Initial state inactive. Activate via `cclaw skill setup` after requirement verification.

### CLAUDE.md Composition

`compose_claude_md()` merges bot profile + skill SKILL.md content into a single CLAUDE.md.
Without skills, output is identical to the existing `generate_claude_md()`.
CLAUDE.md is auto-regenerated when `save_bot_config()` is called.
On bot start, `regenerate_bot_claude_md()` reflects the latest skill state.

### Circular Reference Resolution

Bidirectional dependency exists between `config.py` and `skill.py`.
Resolved via lazy import: `from cclaw.skill import compose_claude_md` inside `save_bot_config()` in `config.py`.

### MCP Skills

MCP skills define `mcpServers` configuration in `mcp.json` files.
During `run_claude()`, `merge_mcp_configs()` merges all linked MCP skill configs
and creates `.mcp.json` in the session directory. Claude Code auto-detects this file.

### CLI Skill Environment Variables

CLI skills store values in `skill.yaml`'s `environment_variable_values`.
Environment variable values are collected during `cclaw skills setup`.
During `run_claude()`, `collect_skill_environment_variables()` gathers them
and injects into the subprocess `env` parameter.

### Skill Setup with Unconfigured Environment Variables

`cclaw skills setup` normally skips already-active skills. However, if a skill is active but has unconfigured environment variables (empty values), setup re-enters the environment variable prompt. This handles the case where `cclaw skills install` auto-activates an MCP skill (no `required_commands` failure) before environment variables are set.

### Session CLAUDE.md Propagation

`ensure_session()` maintains existing behavior (copies bot CLAUDE.md only when session CLAUDE.md doesn't exist).
On skill attach/detach, `update_session_claude_md()` explicitly overwrites CLAUDE.md in all existing sessions.

### Telegram /skills Handler

The `/skills` command queries installed skill list via `list_skills()`,
and displays link status for each skill via `bots_using_skill()`.
Skills not linked to any bot are also included.
Additionally, `list_builtin_skills()` shows uninstalled built-in skills at the bottom.

## Cron Schedule Automation

### cron.yaml Schema

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: morning-email       # Job identifier
    schedule: "0 9 * * *"     # Standard cron expression
    timezone: "Asia/Seoul"    # Optional (defaults to UTC)
    message: "Summarize today's morning emails"
    skills: [gmail]           # Optional (uses bot's default skills if omitted)
    model: haiku              # Optional (uses bot's default model if omitted)
    enabled: true
  - name: call-reminder       # One-shot job
    at: "2026-02-20T15:00:00" # ISO datetime or "30m"/"2h"/"1d"
    message: "Time for client callback"
    delete_after_run: true    # Auto-delete after execution
```

### Per-Job Timezone

- Optional `timezone` field per job (e.g., `Asia/Seoul`, `America/New_York`)
- Defaults to UTC when omitted
- `resolve_job_timezone()` resolves timezone name via `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo`, falls back to UTC on invalid name
- Cron expressions are evaluated in the job's timezone: `datetime.now(job_timezone)` is used instead of UTC
- `next_run_time()` also returns time in the job's timezone for display
- Last run times are tracked in UTC internally to avoid DST issues

### Scheduler Behavior

- `bot_manager.py` launches `asyncio.create_task(run_cron_scheduler())` on bot start
- Checks current time against job schedules every 30 seconds
- Calculates fire time for current minute via `croniter`'s `get_next()` in the job's timezone
- Records last run time in UTC (`last_run_times` dict) to prevent duplicate execution within same minute
- `stop_event` for graceful shutdown (cron shuts down with bot)

### Result Delivery

- Sends to all `allowed_users` via `application.bot.send_message()`
- In DMs, user_id == chat_id, so no separate chat ID management needed
- **Session chat ID fallback**: When `allowed_users` is empty, `collect_session_chat_ids()` scans `sessions/chat_<id>/` directories to find users who have previously chatted with the bot. Skips sending only when both `allowed_users` and session chat IDs are empty
- Prepends `[cron: job_name]` header to messages

### Working Directory Isolation

- Each job runs in `~/.cclaw/bots/{name}/cron_sessions/{job_name}/`
- Bot's CLAUDE.md is copied so Claude Code recognizes bot context
- Completely isolated from regular sessions, no interference between cron jobs

### One-Shot Jobs

- `at` field triggers one-shot execution instead of schedule
- Supports ISO 8601 datetime (`2026-02-20T15:00:00`) or duration shorthand (`30m`, `2h`, `1d`)
- **Relative-to-absolute conversion**: `add_cron_job()` converts relative durations (e.g., `10m`) to absolute ISO datetime at creation time. Without this, the scheduler would re-evaluate `parse_one_shot_time("10m")` every 30-second cycle, always computing `now + 10m`, causing the job to never fire
- **Post-execution cleanup**: `delete_after_run: true` auto-deletes from `cron.yaml`. `delete_after_run: false` sets `enabled: false` to prevent re-execution on restart (since `last_run_times` is in-memory only and lost on restart)

### Telegram /skills Handler (Unified)

The `/skills` handler manages skill listing, attach, and detach (previous `/skill` handler merged into `/skills`).
The `attached_skills` variable in the handler closure tracks currently linked skills.
After attach/detach, the local `bot_config["skills"]` is directly updated to sync memory and disk state.
(`attach_skill_to_bot()` only modifies the on-disk config, so the in-memory `bot_config` must be updated separately.)
`run_claude()` receives `skill_names=attached_skills`.
Uninstalled built-in skills are also listed at the bottom via `list_builtin_skills()`.

### Built-in Skills

The `src/cclaw/builtin_skills/` package contains skill templates.
`install_builtin_skill()` copies template files to `~/.cclaw/skills/<name>/` via `shutil.copy2`.
The `install_hints` field (dict) in `skill.yaml` provides installation guidance for missing tools.
`check_skill_requirements()` reads `install_hints` and includes `Install: <hint>` format in error messages.

## Session Continuity (Conversation Bootstrap + --resume)

### Problem

`claude -p` runs as a new process each time and doesn't remember previous conversations.
Context breaks occur when multi-turn flows are needed, like the iMessage skill.
(e.g., "Show messages from John" -> "What would you like to do with this number?")

### Solution

Two mechanisms are combined:

1. **Conversation bootstrap**: On first message, composes bootstrap prompt in order: global memory -> bot memory -> last 20 turns (`MAX_CONVERSATION_HISTORY_TURNS`) from conversation files -> new message
2. **`--resume <session_id>`**: Claude Code's session continuation flag maintains context for subsequent messages

### Session ID Management

- UUID stored in `.claude_session_id` file (`sessions/chat_<id>/.claude_session_id`)
- `get_claude_session_id()`: Reads session ID from file (None if absent)
- `save_claude_session_id()`: Saves session ID to file
- `clear_claude_session_id()`: Deletes session ID file (`missing_ok=True`)

### Daily Conversation Rotation

Conversation history is stored in daily rotating files (`conversation-YYMMDD.md`) instead of a single `conversation.md`.

- **File naming**: `conversation-YYMMDD.md` (UTC date, e.g., `conversation-260225.md`)
- **Writing**: `log_conversation()` always appends to today's dated file
- **Reading**: `load_conversation_history()` searches dated files newest-first, collecting turns until `max_turns` is reached
- **Legacy fallback**: Reads existing `conversation.md` when no dated files exist (no migration needed)
- **Reset**: `/reset` deletes all dated files + legacy file. `/resetall` removes the entire session directory
- **Glob pattern**: Strict `conversation-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9].md` pattern prevents matching non-conversation files
- **Status display**: `conversation_status_summary()` reports total size and file count for `/status` command

### Conversation History Parsing

`load_conversation_history()` parses conversation files.

- Searches `conversation-YYMMDD.md` files in reverse chronological order (newest first)
- Falls back to legacy `conversation.md` when no dated files exist
- Splits sections via regex `re.split(r"(?=\n## (?:user|assistant) \()", content)`
- Recognizes sections in `## user (timestamp)` or `## assistant (timestamp)` format
- Collects turns across multiple files until `max_turns` is reached
- Returns only the most recent `max_turns` sections
- Returns None if no conversation files exist or all are empty

### Handler Flow

`_prepare_session_context(session_directory, user_message)`:
1. Calls `get_claude_session_id()`
2. If session ID exists: `resume_session=True`, uses original message as-is
3. If no session ID: Generates new UUID -> Composes bootstrap prompt (global memory -> bot memory -> conversation history -> message) -> `save_claude_session_id()`

`_call_with_resume_fallback(send_function, ...)`:
1. First call with configured settings (resume or new session)
2. If `resume_session=True` and `RuntimeError` occurs:
   - Calls `clear_claude_session_id()`
   - Generates new UUID -> Recomposes with bootstrap prompt (same order: global memory -> bot memory -> conversation history -> message)
   - Retries with `resume_session=False`

### Claude Runner Flags

Parameters added to `run_claude()` and `run_claude_streaming()`:
- `claude_session_id: str | None = None`
- `resume_session: bool = False`

Command build:
- `resume_session=True` + `claude_session_id` -> `--resume <id>`
- `resume_session=False` + `claude_session_id` -> `--session-id <id>`

### Reset

`reset_session()` and `reset_all_session()` include `clear_claude_session_id()` calls
so `/reset` and `/resetall` also delete the session ID.

## Bot-Level Long-Term Memory

### Storage Location

`~/.cclaw/bots/<name>/MEMORY.md` — Bot-level file shared across all chat sessions.

### Save Mechanism

Claude Code directly writes to MEMORY.md via its file write tool.
The CLAUDE.md generated by `compose_claude_md()` includes memory instructions and the absolute path to MEMORY.md,
so when Claude Code receives "remember this" requests, it organizes by category and appends to the file.

### Load Mechanism

`_prepare_session_context()` reads GLOBAL_MEMORY.md via `load_global_memory()` and MEMORY.md via `load_bot_memory()` when composing the bootstrap prompt.
Injection order: **global memory -> bot memory -> conversation history -> new message**. Each section is separated by `---`.
`--resume` sessions don't inject memory separately since the Claude Code session maintains its own context.

### Memory Instructions in CLAUDE.md

When `bot_path` parameter is passed to `compose_claude_md()`, a Memory section is added after the Rules section.
`save_bot_config()` and `regenerate_bot_claude_md()` automatically pass `bot_path`.

## Global Memory

### Storage Location

`~/.cclaw/GLOBAL_MEMORY.md` — Root-level file shared across all bots (read-only for bots).

### CRUD Functions

In `session.py`: `global_memory_file_path()`, `load_global_memory()`, `save_global_memory()`, `clear_global_memory()`.
Same pattern as bot memory CRUD. `load_global_memory()` returns `None` when file is missing or empty/whitespace-only.

### Injection Points

Global memory is injected at four points:

1. **CLAUDE.md composition** (`compose_claude_md()` in `skill.py`): "Global Memory (Read-Only)" section placed before bot Memory section. No file path exposed to prevent Claude from modifying it.
2. **Session bootstrap** (`_prepare_session_context()` in `handlers.py`): Injected as first context part in bootstrap prompt.
3. **Resume fallback** (`_call_with_resume_fallback()` in `handlers.py`): Same injection on `--resume` failure fallback.
4. **Cron/Heartbeat execution** (`execute_cron_job()` in `cron.py`, `execute_heartbeat()` in `heartbeat.py`): Injected before bot memory in the prompt.

### CLI Management

`cclaw global-memory show|edit|clear`. After `edit` or `clear`, `_regenerate_all_bots_claude_md()` iterates all bots and regenerates CLAUDE.md + propagates to all sessions via `update_session_claude_md()`.

## macOS Contacts Lookup (osascript)

The iMessage skill uses `osascript` for name-based contact lookups.

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "Contacts" to get {name, value of phones} of every person whose name contains "search term"'
```

- Partial matching supported: Searching "John" matches "John Smith"
- Prompts user for confirmation when there are duplicate names
- Requires `Bash(osascript:*)` in skill.yaml's `allowed_tools`

## macOS Reminders Permission (reminders-cli)

`reminders-cli` (`brew install keith/formulae/reminders-cli`) requires TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) permission to access the macOS Reminders app.

### Permission Popup May Not Appear Automatically

Unlike regular apps, `reminders-cli` may not automatically trigger the macOS permission request popup on first run. Terminal may not appear in the Reminders permission list in System Settings, and the "+" button may not exist for manual addition.

### Solution: Trigger Permission via osascript

AppleScript calls via `osascript` properly trigger the macOS permission popup.

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "Reminders" to get name of every list'
```

Selecting "Allow" in the popup adds Terminal to the Reminders permission list, after which `reminders-cli` works normally.

### TCC Reset

If `osascript` also fails to show the popup, reset the TCC database and retry.

```bash
tccutil reset Reminders
osascript -e 'tell application "Reminders" to get name of every list'
```

### Fallback: Full Disk Access

If all above methods fail, adding Terminal.app to **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access** serves as a workaround. Full Disk Access includes Reminders access.

### Daemon Mode Note

When running via `cclaw start --daemon`, the shell used by `launchd` also needs the same permissions.

## Heartbeat (Periodic Situation Awareness)

### Configuration Location

Unlike cron which uses a separate `cron.yaml`, heartbeat is stored in the `heartbeat` section of `bot.yaml` (one per bot).

```yaml
heartbeat:
  enabled: false
  interval_minutes: 30
  active_hours:
    start: "07:00"
    end: "23:00"
```

### HEARTBEAT_OK Marker

When `HEARTBEAT_OK_MARKER = "HEARTBEAT_OK"` string is present in Claude's response, no notification is sent.
Exact case match (`HEARTBEAT_OK in response`).
The HEARTBEAT.md template includes the rule "HEARTBEAT_OK must be included at the end of every response".

### Active Hours

Compares local time (`datetime.now()`) in HH:MM format.
Midnight-crossing supported: When `start > end`, treated as overnight range (e.g., 22:00-06:00).

### Dynamic Config in Scheduler

`run_heartbeat_scheduler()` re-reads bot.yaml via `load_bot_config()` every cycle.
Runtime enable/disable via Telegram `/heartbeat on`/`off` takes effect from the next cycle.

### HEARTBEAT.md Creation Timing

On bot creation (`onboarding.py`), only the `heartbeat` config is added to bot.yaml; HEARTBEAT.md is not created.
HEARTBEAT.md is auto-generated from default template when `cclaw heartbeat enable` or Telegram `/heartbeat on` is executed and the file doesn't exist.

### Working Directory

Claude Code runs in `~/.cclaw/bots/{name}/heartbeat_sessions/`.
Bot's CLAUDE.md is copied and a workspace/ subdirectory is created.
Same isolation pattern as cron_sessions/.

### Result Delivery

Sends to all `allowed_users` in bot.yaml. Falls back to session chat IDs via `collect_session_chat_ids()` when `allowed_users` is empty (same fallback as cron).
Prepends `[heartbeat: bot_name]` header to messages.

## Supabase MCP Skill (No-Deletion Guardrails)

### Dual-Layer Permission Defense

The Supabase skill uses two complementary defense layers to prevent data deletion:

**Layer 1 — Hard block via `allowed_tools`**: Destructive MCP tools (`delete_branch`, `reset_branch`, `pause_project`, `restore_project`) are excluded from `skill.yaml`'s `allowed_tools` list. In Claude Code's `-p` mode, tools not in `allowed_tools` cannot receive auto-approval, so they are effectively blocked from execution. The `_write_session_settings()` function in `claude_runner.py` writes only the safe tools to `.claude/settings.json`.

**Layer 2 — Soft block via SKILL.md instructions**: For tools that are allowed but can perform destructive operations (notably `execute_sql` which can run any SQL), SKILL.md contains explicit guardrails forbidding `DELETE FROM`, `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, and related statements. Claude is instructed to suggest soft delete patterns instead.

### MCP Server Environment Variable Injection

The Supabase MCP server requires `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`. This flows through the skill system:

1. `skill.yaml` declares `environment_variables: [SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN]`
2. `cclaw skills setup supabase` prompts the user and stores the value in `environment_variable_values`
3. `collect_skill_environment_variables()` reads the stored value during `run_claude()`
4. The value is injected into the subprocess `env` parameter
5. The MCP server (started by Claude Code) inherits the environment variable

### MCP Config Merging

The `mcp.json` in the skill directory defines the Supabase MCP server configuration. During `run_claude()`, `merge_mcp_configs()` combines all attached MCP skill configs into a single `.mcp.json` file in the session working directory. Claude Code auto-detects this file and starts the configured MCP servers.

## Per-Skill Emoji Display

Each builtin skill has an `emoji` field in its `skill.yaml` (e.g., `"\U0001F4AC"` for iMessage). This emoji is displayed in:

- **CLI**: `cclaw skills` table prepends emoji to skill name
- **Telegram**: `/skills` command uses skill emoji instead of generic checkmarks for active skills

### Builtin Fallback

Already-installed skills (copied to `~/.cclaw/skills/`) may lack the `emoji` field if installed before it was added. `list_skills()` in `skill.py` falls back to the builtin template's emoji via `get_builtin_skill_path()` when the installed config has no emoji.

## Twitter/X MCP Skill

### MCP Server Environment Variable Mapping

The `@enescinar/twitter-mcp` package expects generic env var names (`API_KEY`, `API_SECRET_KEY`, `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`). To avoid namespace collision with other skills, cclaw uses `TWITTER_`-prefixed names in `skill.yaml`:

- `TWITTER_API_KEY`
- `TWITTER_API_SECRET_KEY`
- `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`

The `mcp.json` uses a `/bin/sh -c` wrapper to map prefixed env vars to the generic names the package expects:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "twitter": {
      "command": "/bin/sh",
      "args": ["-c", "API_KEY=\"$TWITTER_API_KEY\" ... npx -y @enescinar/twitter-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

This shell wrapper approach is necessary because:
1. Static `mcp.json` cannot reference dynamic env var values
2. Claude Code's MCP config `env` block requires literal values
3. The `/bin/sh` command renames the env vars at MCP server launch time

### Safety Guardrails

SKILL.md enforces confirmation before posting. The bot must show the full tweet text and receive user approval before calling `post_tweet`. Character limit (280) is checked before posting.

### Rate Limits

Free tier: 500 posts/month (~16 per day). The skill instructs Claude to inform users when rate limits are exceeded.

## Jira MCP Skill

### MCP Server

The Jira skill uses `sooperset/mcp-atlassian` (Python package) via `uvx`. Unlike the Twitter skill, no `/bin/sh -c` wrapper is needed because the package natively reads `JIRA_`-prefixed environment variables (`JIRA_URL`, `JIRA_USERNAME`, `JIRA_API_TOKEN`), which matches the cclaw skill convention.

### Environment Variable Flow

1. `skill.yaml` declares `environment_variables: [JIRA_URL, JIRA_USERNAME, JIRA_API_TOKEN]`
2. `cclaw skills setup jira` prompts the user and stores values in `environment_variable_values`
3. `collect_skill_environment_variables()` reads stored values during `run_claude()`
4. Values are injected into the subprocess `env` parameter
5. The MCP server (started by Claude Code via `uvx mcp-atlassian`) inherits the environment variables

### Safety Guardrails

SKILL.md enforces confirmation before creating issues and before transitioning workflow status. Issue deletion is forbidden — closing or moving is suggested instead. Bulk modifications require explicit approval.

### Allowed Tools

Only 5 tools are auto-approved: `jira_search`, `jira_get_issue`, `jira_create_issue`, `jira_update_issue`, `jira_transition_issue`. The `mcp-atlassian` package also provides Confluence tools, but they are not listed in `allowed_tools` and therefore blocked in `-p` mode.

## Token Compact

### Target Selection

`collect_compact_targets()` collects three types of files:

1. **MEMORY.md** (`~/.cclaw/bots/<name>/MEMORY.md`): Bot long-term memory that grows over time
2. **User-created SKILL.md**: Skills attached to the bot, excluding builtins (`is_builtin_skill()` check). Builtin skills are already compressed at build time
3. **HEARTBEAT.md** (`~/.cclaw/bots/<name>/heartbeat_sessions/HEARTBEAT.md`): Periodic check checklist

Empty files (whitespace-only) are skipped.

### Compression Approach

Each target is compressed via a separate one-shot `claude -p` call with a structured prompt (`COMPACT_PROMPT`). The `document_type` parameter provides context-specific guidance (e.g., "Bot long-term memory" vs "AI assistant skill instructions").

Each call runs in a fresh `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` — no session state, no MCP config, no skill injection needed.

### Token Estimation

`estimate_token_count()` uses `len(text) // 4` (minimum 1). This is a rough heuristic sufficient for relative before/after comparison in the report. Not intended for billing accuracy.

### Error Isolation

`run_compact()` processes targets sequentially. If one target's compression fails (Claude timeout, runtime error, etc.), the error is captured in `CompactResult.error` and remaining targets continue processing. `save_compact_results()` only writes back results with no error.

### Post-Save Propagation

After saving compacted files, both CLI and Telegram handlers call `regenerate_bot_claude_md()` + `update_session_claude_md()` to propagate SKILL.md changes into bot and session CLAUDE.md files.

## IME-Compatible CLI Input

### Problem

`Rich.Console.input()` and `typer.prompt()` (which uses `click.prompt`) interfere with CJK IME composition in certain terminals (e.g., Warp). Korean characters break during composition, producing garbled or incomplete input.

### Solution

All CLI input prompts use Python's builtin `input()` wrapped in two utility functions in `utils.py`:

- `prompt_input(label, default=None)`: Single-line input. Uses `Rich.Console.print()` for label display, then `input()` for actual input capture. Optional `default` parameter returns the default value when input is empty.
- `prompt_multiline(label)`: Multi-line input. Reads lines until an empty line is entered. Used for bot personality, description, cron messages, etc.

### Applied Locations

- `onboarding.py`: Bot Token, Bot name, personality, description
- `cli.py` skill commands: skill name, description, type, required commands, environment variables, environment variable values
- `cli.py` cron commands: job name, schedule, timezone, at value, message, skills, model

### Not Changed

- `typer.confirm()` (y/n prompts): These work correctly with IME since they only accept single ASCII characters.
- `typer.Argument` / `typer.Option`: These are parsed from command-line arguments, not interactive prompts.
